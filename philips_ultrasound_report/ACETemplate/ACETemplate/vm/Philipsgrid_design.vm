## Generate an ASP.Net 2.0 web form
## More work is needed, as I do not have a functional page, just a sketch-up.
## It is missing proper support for non-string datatypes.  This template also
## needs lookup support for related tables, with either a listed description
## field or a drop-down selection of choices for "small" tables.
