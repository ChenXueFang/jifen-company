                    The Career Site gathers certain information automatically when a user interacts with the site and
                    stores that information in log files. This information includes Internet protocol (IP) addresses,
                    browser type, Internet service provider (ISP), referring/exit pages, operating system, date/time
                    stamp, and clickstream data. These IP addresses are not stored after you end your session.
                    <br>
                    We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to: (i) analyze trends; (ii)
                    administer the site; (iii) track users movements around the site; and (iv) gather demographic
                    information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically collected data to
